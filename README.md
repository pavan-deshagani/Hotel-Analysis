# 🏨 Hotel Booking Analysis

## 📋 Overview
The **Hotel Booking Analysis Project** aims to explore, clean, and analyze hotel booking data to uncover meaningful insights about booking patterns, customer behavior, and factors influencing cancellations and special requests.  
This project demonstrates strong skills in **Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
The main goals of this project are:
- To identify **the prime time to secure a hotel room**.  
- To determine **the ideal length of stay** for the best rates.  
- To explore **factors influencing special requests** at hotels.  
- To analyze **when bookings are typically made**.  
- To understand **the relationship between stay length and daily rates**.  
- To study **how demographics influence booking behavior**.  
- To uncover **key patterns and dynamics** in hotel reservations.

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### 1. Data Cleaning
- Handled missing values and duplicates  
- Converted data types  
- Created new calculated columns (e.g., total nights, total guests)

### 2. Data Exploration
- Visualized distributions and relationships  
- Compared booking trends across years and hotel types  
- Analyzed cancellation patterns  

### 3. Key Questions Explored
| S.No | Question |
|------|-----------|
| 1 | What is the prime time to secure a hotel room? |
| 2 | What is the ideal length of stay for the best rates? |
| 3 | What factors lead to a surge in special requests? |
| 4 | When are bookings typically made? |
| 5 | How does the length of stay correlate with daily rates? |
| 6 | What demographic factors influence booking patterns? |
| 7 | What are the key dynamics governing hotel reservations? |
